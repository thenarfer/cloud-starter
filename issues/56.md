## Tech debt / Chore
Focus on risk reduction, maintainability, and developer ergonomics.

### Area / Scope (optional)
Process/Project

### Debt type
Process

### Why now (risk/benefit)
Issue forms currently use an **unsupported schema** for `projects:`.  
They include nested objects (`url` + `workflow`), which GitHub ignores. This prevents issues from being auto-assigned to the intended project and breaks form rendering.

Fixing this ensures:
- Issues are automatically added to the right project (`thenarfer/1`).
- Templates stay valid and maintainable.
- No reliance on invalid YAML fields that could silently fail.

### Proposed change
- Update affected templates:
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml`
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml`
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/sprint-plan.yml`
  - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tech-debt.yml`
- Replace blocks like:

  ```yaml
  projects:
    - url: https://github.com/users/thenarfer/projects/1
      workflow: .github/workflows/add-to-project.yml
  ```

with the valid format:

```yaml
projects:
  - thenarfer/1
```

* Leave the workflow (`.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml`) unchanged; it handles automation independently.

### Acceptance Criteria (checklist)

* [ ] All templates use valid `projects: - thenarfer/1` syntax.
* [ ] New issues created via templates are auto-assigned to the correct project.
* [ ] Forms render without missing fields.
* [ ] CI green.
* [ ] Rollback plan: revert templates if schema breaks unexpectedly.

### Ready to start (DoR)

* [x] Impact clarified (risk/benefit)
* [x] Scope small enough for a single PR (or clearly chunked)

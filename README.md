# Cloud Starter

This is a transparent learning project. I am setting up a small proof-of-concept service in the cloud on Azure Norway East and AWS Stockholm. The work is done in small steps with clear done criteria, CI/CD, Terraform, basic monitoring and cost tracking.

## Project Board
Public Kanban tracking the work.
